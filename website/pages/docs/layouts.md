Layouts are Vue components that wrap around your page. They allow you to have the source code for your template in one place so you donâ€™t have to repeat things like your navigation and footer on every page.

You can set the `layout` key under [`page`](./pages.md#the-page-object) object to use a layout component from `layouts` folder:

```markdown
---
title: Hello World
layout: post
---

This is a page.
```

The parsed [`page`](./pages.md#the-page-object) object will look like:

```js
{
  title: 'Hello World',
  layout: 'post'
}
```

This will be passed to the layout component as `page` prop, so you can use it like this in `layouts/post.vue`:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
    <slot name="default" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  props: ['page']
}
</script>
```

Note that the page content is available as the default slot, you can use it like this: `<slot name="default"></slot>`.

You can also set the layout using ES6 `export const page = {}` as we mentioned in the [pages](./pages.md#the-page-object) documentation.
